# Animal Shelter Data Analysis

This project explores the **Petfinder Animal Shelters dataset** from Kaggle to understand the distribution of animal shelters across North America, with a focus on **Canadian shelters**.

## Project Overview
- **Dataset**: [Petfinder Animal Shelters (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aaronschlegel/petfinder-animal-shelters-database)  
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Key Steps
1. **Data Loading** – Downloaded the dataset with `kagglehub` and loaded it into Pandas.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Checked for missing values (latitude/longitude and zip codes are complete).  
3. **Exploratory Analysis** –  
   - Visualized the top 10 states and cities by number of shelters.  
   - Filtered shelters by country.  
4. **Canadian Focus** – Subset created for Canadian shelters to enable country-specific insights.

## Results
- Identified which states and cities have the highest shelter counts.  
- Created a clean dataset of Canadian shelters for further analysis or mapping.
