# Animal Shelter Database
While there are hundreds of animal shelters across Canada, accessibility varies greatly by geography and population density. A simple lookup directory is useful, but a data-driven approach can identify underserved areas, optimize shelter placement, and improve resource allocation.

**Objective**
1. Build a searchable shelter directory
2. Quantify shelter accessibility by population.
3. Use predictive modeling and optimization to identify where additional shelters could maximize accessibility.

**Data**
The dataset used is from ["aaronschlegel/petfinder-animal-shelters-database" ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aaronschlegel/petfinder-animal-shelters-database)
